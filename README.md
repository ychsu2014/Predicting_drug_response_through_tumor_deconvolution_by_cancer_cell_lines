# [Predicting drug response through tumor deconvolution by cancer cell lines](https://github.com/ychsu2014/Predicting_drug_response_through_tumor_deconvolution_by_cancer_cell_lines)
## Summary
Large-scale cancer drug sensitivity data have become available for a collection of cancer cell lines, but only limited drug response data from patients are available. Bridging the gap of pharmacogenomics knowledge between in vitro and in vivo datasets remains challenging. In this study, we trained a deep-learning model, Scaden-CA, for deconvoluting tumor data into proportions of cancer type-specific cell lines. Then, a drug response prediction method was developed using the deconvoluted proportions and the drug sensitivity data from cell lines. The Scaden-CA model showed excellent performance in terms of concordance correlation coefficients (> 0.9 for model testing) and the correctly deconvoluted rate (> 70% across most cancers) for model validation using CCLE bulk RNA data. We applied the model to tumors in the TCGA dataset and examined associations between predicted cell viability and mutation status or gene expression levels for understanding underlying mechanisms of potential value for drug repurposing.
